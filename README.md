Save My Tabs is a Chrome extension that stores the list of open tabs in a text file in Dropbox.

This is published in the Chrome Web Store at [TODO](TODO)

After installing the extension, go to the options page to sign in to Dropbox. The extension requests app permissions, so the file will be saved in the `Apps/Save My Tabs/ChromeTabs.txt` file.
