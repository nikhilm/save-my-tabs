Save My Tabs is a Chrome extension that stores the list of open tabs in a text file in Dropbox.

This is pending publishing in the Chrome Web Store at [TODO](TODO). For now you can download a zip from [Releases](https://github.com/nikhilm/save-my-tabs/releases).

After installing the extension, go to the options page to sign in to Dropbox. The extension requests app permissions, so the file will be saved in the `Apps/Save My Tabs/ChromeTabs.txt` file.
